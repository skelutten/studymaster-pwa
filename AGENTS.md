# studymaster â€” LLM Agent Guide

These instructions are for **LLM agents** assisting on this Typescript project.

## 1. Project Context & Role


## 2. Development Environment

### Prerequisites


### Quick Start Commands


### Key URLs

- App: 
- Admin: 
- Health:
- Metrics:

## 3. Workflow Expectations

1. **Phase Discipline**: Work only within current phase and scope

2. **Development Flow**:

3. **Code Changes**:
   - Provide ready-to-use code snippets
   - Include migration commands when models change
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Follow conventional commit messages

## 4. Technical Standards

| Topic | Standard |
|-------|----------|
| Settings | |
| Testing |  |
| Logging | Structured JSON (prod), human-readable (dev) |
| Observability ||
| Commits | Conventional (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.) |


## 5. Core Models

### Current Schema

(update when decided)

## 6. Health & Monitoring

### Health Endpoints


### Observability

- **Metrics**: TODO
- **Tracing**: TODO
- **Logs**: TODO

## 7. Testing Strategy

```bash
# Run full suite
fixme

# With coverage
fixme

# Specific tests
fixme
```

## 8. Common References

- `docs/PLAN.md`: Project phases and decisions
- `docs/accounts.md`: User accounts and authentication flow
- `README.md`: Project description and overview
- `docs\StudyMaster-Design-Plan.md`: Original design plan
## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```bash
# Reset everything
TODO Fixme

# Container shell access
TODO fixme

# View logs
TODO fixme

# Database issues
TODO fixme
```

## 10. Next Actions

Before implementing features, verify:

1. Does the change fit within current scope?
2. Are tests included?
3. Do server or client need rebuilding?
4. Do we need to re-deploy from scratch?
5. Are environment variables documented in `.env.example`?
6. Should the project documentation be updated? README.md, docs/*, AGENTS.md

When in doubt, ask for clarification on scope and requirements!
