# Security & Environment Configuration

## üîí API Keys & Credentials Removed

All API keys and sensitive credentials have been removed from the Git repository for security.

## üìÅ Environment Files Structure

### Template Files (Tracked by Git)
- `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Contains placeholder values for Supabase setup
- `client/vercel.json` - Contains placeholder environment variables  
- `client/.env.local` - Template with placeholder values (ignored by git)

### Production Files (NOT tracked by Git)
- `.env.production` - Contains actual production API keys and credentials
- `client/.env.production` - Contains complete production environment setup

## üîë Production Credentials Location

All real API keys, database passwords, and secrets are stored in:
- **Root level**: `.env.production`
- **Client level**: `client/.env.production`

These files contain:
- Supabase API keys and JWT secrets
- Database connection strings and passwords
- S3 access keys and secrets
- Production server URLs

## üöÄ Deployment Setup

### For Production Deployment:
1. Copy values from `client/.env.production` to your deployment platform
2. Set environment variables in Vercel/Railway/etc using these values
3. Ensure production files are never committed to Git

### For Local Development:
1. Copy `client/.env.production` to `client/.env.local` if needed
2. Modify values for local development
3. The `.env.local` file will be ignored by Git

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

- **Never commit real API keys to Git**
- Production files (`.env.production`) are excluded via `.gitignore`
- Git history has been cleaned to remove previously committed credentials
- Use environment variables in deployment platforms instead of committing secrets

## üìã Checklist for New Developers

- [ ] Get production credentials from team lead (not from Git)
- [ ] Create local `.env.production` files with real values
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` excludes your environment files
- [ ] Never commit files containing real API keys or passwords

## üõ°Ô∏è Git History Cleanup

The repository history has been cleaned using `git filter-branch` to remove:
- API keys from `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
- API keys from `client/vercel.json`
- Complete credentials from `client/.env.local`

All sensitive data has been completely purged from Git history.
