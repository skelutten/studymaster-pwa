# Security & Environment Configuration

## 🔒 API Keys & Credentials Removed

All API keys and sensitive credentials have been removed from the Git repository for security.

## 📁 Environment Files Structure

### Template Files (Tracked by Git)

- `client/vercel.json` - Contains placeholder environment variables  
- `client/.env.example` - Template with placeholder values







## ⚠️ Security Notes

- **Never commit real API keys to Git**
- Production files (`.env.production`) are excluded via `.gitignore`
- Git history has been cleaned to remove previously committed credentials
- Use environment variables in deployment platforms instead of committing secrets

## 📋 Checklist for New Developers

- [ ] Get production credentials from team lead (not from Git)
- [ ] Create local `.env.production` files with real values
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` excludes your environment files
- [ ] Never commit files containing real API keys or passwords
