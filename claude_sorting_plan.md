# Adaptive Difficulty-Based Scheduler (ADS) Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing an improved spaced repetition algorithm with dynamic difficulty-based deck sorting for StudyMaster PWA. The proposed Adaptive Difficulty-Based Scheduler (ADS) is inspired by cutting-edge research from Anki's FSRS algorithm, Quizlet's memory scoring, and modern spaced repetition science.

## 📊 Research Analysis

### Current Spaced Repetition Landscape

#### Anki's Algorithm Evolution
- **Foundation**: SuperMemo 2 (SM-2) algorithm from the 1980s
- **Modern Implementation**: FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) as of Anki 23.10
- **Key Features**:
  - 4-choice grading system (again, hard, good, easy)
  - Ease factors ranging from 1.3 to 2.5 (1300-5000 internally)
  - Queue-based card prioritization (-2=buried, -1=suspended, 0=new, 1=learning, 2=review, 3=day learning)
  - Configurable learning steps and intervals

#### FSRS-5 Innovation
- **Core Model**: Difficulty-Stability-Retrievability (DSR) framework
- **Performance**: 20-30% fewer reviews for same retention compared to SM-2
- **Optimization**: 21-parameter machine learning model
- **Difficulty Scale**: 1-10 granular difficulty rating
- **Success Rate**: Better than SM-2 for 99% of users (benchmarked on ~10,000 users)
- **Retention Control**: Customizable 70-97% retention targets

#### Quizlet's Approach
- **Memory Score System**: Tracks user performance and provides personalized recommendations
- **Difficulty Tracking**: Identifies challenging terms requiring more revision
- **Limitations**: Premium-only spaced repetition, less sophisticated than dedicated SRS systems

### StudyMaster's Current Implementation Analysis

#### Strengths
- ✅ Comprehensive Anki-style card states (`new`, `learning`, `review`, `relearning`, `suspended`, `buried`)
- ✅ Advanced queue management system with proper state-queue consistency
- ✅ Built-in difficulty rating field (`difficultyRating: number // 1-5`)
- ✅ Performance tracking (`totalStudyTime`, `averageAnswerTime`)
- ✅ Sophisticated study queue manager with O(n) performance optimization
- ✅ Daily limits and advanced deck settings
- ✅ Card state validation and migration system

#### Current Limitations
- Static sorting based only on due dates and card states
- Limited utilization of existing `difficultyRating` field
- No dynamic difficulty adjustment based on user performance
- Missing adaptive interval calculation based on perceived difficulty
- No context-aware scheduling (time of day, fatigue, cognitive load)

## 🎯 Proposed Solution: Adaptive Difficulty-Based Scheduler (ADS)

### Core Innovation Principles

1. **Real-Time Difficulty Assessment**: Continuously update difficulty ratings based on user responses, timing, and patterns
2. **Context-Aware Sorting**: Dynamically adjust card order based on difficulty, user fatigue, optimal learning patterns, and cognitive load theory
3. **Performance-Based Intervals**: Modify interval calculations using difficulty scores, response consistency, and individual learning velocity
4. **Adaptive Learning Patterns**: Learn user's optimal study patterns and adjust scheduling accordingly

### Key Algorithmic Improvements

#### Enhanced Difficulty Tracking
```typescript
interface DifficultyMetrics {
  cardId: string
  perceivedDifficulty: number // 1-10 (more granular than current 1-5)
  responsePattern: ResponseType[] // Recent response history
  averageResponseTime: number
  consistencyScore: number // How consistent user responses are
  difficultyTrend: 'increasing' | 'decreasing' | 'stable'
  confidenceScore: number // Algorithm confidence in difficulty rating
  lastUpdated: string

}
```

#### Smart Sorting Algorithms
- **Difficulty Gradient Sorting**: Gradually increase difficulty within study sessions
